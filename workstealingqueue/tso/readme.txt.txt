########TSO Proof of Work-Stealing-Queue########

Files :

VERIFIED-ATOMICITY.bpl : Atomic blocks with correctness specification assertions discharged.
WSQ-From-SC-to-TSO.bpl : TSO-Buffer encoded SC work-stealing program.
WSQ-From-SC-to-TSO.qet : Proof script for TSO WSQ-From-SC-to-TSO.bpl .
abstractions.txt : These are the abstractions to be inserted.

ToDo:

1. Intutive correctness specifications to add
2. Update proof script
3. Proof script has to updated for inserting abstractions
